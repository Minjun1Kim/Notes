# Week 1

## Introduction to Software Engineering

### Software Development Lifecycle

- Guides the software development process
- Systematic process to develop high quality software
- Identify discrete steps needed to develop software
- Meets the requirement of the client
- Cycle of planning, design, and implement
- Minimizes the development risks and costs

### Phases in SDLC
#### Six Stages of SDLC
- Planning: requirement gathering and development of the SRS.
- Design: The architecture is developed during the design phase and the design document is created.
- Development: Coding takes place.
- Testing: Issues with the code are found and fixed if possible.
- Deployment: Releasing the code to the production environment.
- Maintenance: Feedback is collected from stakeholders, offer UI issues may be identified, and code enhancements suggested.

Use Cases
- Projects where failures and downtimes are unacceptable (i.e. medical software, aviation fleet, management software)

- SDLC vs STLC

Agile Software Development
- A set of software engineering best practices (allowing for rapid delivery of high quality software)
- A business approach (alignment of business/client needs with goals)

Extreme Programming
- iterative incremental model
- emphaises on technical aspects of software development.
- customer's decision drives the project
- in a nutshell, about good practices taken to an extreme.
- Pair-programming, testing early.
